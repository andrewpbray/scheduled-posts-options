    "text": "The concepts of a variable, its type, and the structure of a data frame are useful because they help guide our thinking about the nature of a data. But we need more than definitions. If our goal is to construct a claim with data, we need to a tool to aid in the construction. Our tool must be able to do two things: it must be able to store the data and it must be able to perform computations on the data.\nIn high school, you gained experience with one such tool: the graphing calculator. This fits our needs: you can enter a list of number into a graphic calculator like the Ti-84, it can store that list and it can execute computations on it, such as taking its sum. But the types of data that a calculator can store are very limited, as is the volume, as are the options for computation.\nIn this class, we will use a tool that is far more powerful: the computer language called R. The Ti-84 is to R what a tricycle is to the space ship. One of these tools can bring you to the end of the block; the other to the moon."

    "text": "You may recognize each of these as summaries of the play, “Hamlet”. None of these are wrong, per se, but they do focus on very different aspects of the work. Summarizing something as rich and complex as Hamlet invariably involves a large degree of omission; we’re reducing a document of 29,551 words down to a single sentence, after all. But summarization also involves important choices around what to include.\nThe same considerations of omission and inclusion come into play when developing a numerical or graphical summary of a data set. Some guidance to bear in mind:\nWhat should I include?\nQualities relevant to the question you’re answering or claim you’re making Features that are aligned with the interest of your audience What should I omit?\nQualities that are irrelevant, distracting, or deceptive Replicated or assumed information"

    "text": "In truth, this plot could be consistent with all these claims. They are, in turn, a descriptive claim, a prediction, a generalization, and a causal claim. This newspaper headline falls squarely in the first category, a descriptive claim, which seeks only to describe the data set that is on hand.\nAlthough 8.3% seems like a simple enough number, is it actually summarizing a vast data set of thousands of prices. The process of describing a data set invariably involves summarizing it, either with numerical summaries like 8.3% or with graphical summaries like the line plot show above.\nIn this unit, we will learn to critique and construct descriptive claims made with data. Although they sound elementary, descriptive claims are the most common form of claim made using data. They have the power to move, if not mountains, at least markets."
